The easiest way to contact us is through our Discord. If you post your message in #general it will be seen by someone who can help.

If there are any issues with the site, such as formatting issues or broken links, then please DM trive (the site maintainer) directly or email him at ted@tedtriv.co.uk so they can be fixed.
